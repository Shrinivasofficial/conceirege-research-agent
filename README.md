Concierge Research Agent

A grounded, web-verified research automation pipeline.

Overview

This project is an experimental research agent that turns a natural-language user goal into a source-verified summary by orchestrating:

Live web search

URL selection

Webpage scraping

Content normalization

Grounded LLM synthesis

Unlike typical “LLM-only” bots, this agent does not rely on model memory or guesswork.
Every final answer is generated only from real, fetched web data.

The goal of this project is to explore hallucination-resistant, verifiable research workflows using small, efficient models like Gemma-2B via Ollama.
